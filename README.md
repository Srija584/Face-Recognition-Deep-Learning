# Face-Recognition-Deep-Learning
This repository contains code used in my paper titled " FACE RECOGNITION from NON-FRONTAL IMAGES Using DEEP NEURAL NETWORK"

"C implementation" contains implementation of model generation for each frontal image from non-frontal template(cnn_weights.c)
 generation of frontal image from  given non-frontal input image and chosen model(cnn_prediction.c)

The main paper has been implemented in C using these two files and matlab helper function(predictCount.m).

Currently, am working on implementation of the same using Keras API(Tensorflow) ,work for which is in progress and draft of the three files for the same('autoEncode.py', 'cnnPrediction.py', 'result.m') have also been uploaded here.
