# Face-Recognition-Deep-Learning
This repository contains code used in my paper titled " FACE RECOGNITION from NON-FRONTAL IMAGES Using DEEP NEURAL NETWORK"

"Generation of weights" contains implementation of model generation for each frontal image from non-frontaltemplate

"Generating frontal image" contains implementation of generating frontal image from  given non-frontal input image and chosen model 

The main paper has been implemented in C using these two files and matlab helper function(not uploaded here).

Currently, am working on implementation of the same using Keras API(Tensorflow) ,work for which is in progress and draft of the three files for the same('autoTest.py', 'cnnFace2.py', 'preProcess.m') have also been uploaded here.
